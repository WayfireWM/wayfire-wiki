Here you can find information about the wayfire compositor.

Wayfire is a general purpose compositor. It's architecture and abilities have been inspired by the Compiz window manager for X11. However, this is by no means a fork of it. The primary goal of the project is to create a good-looking(but still lightweight) DE. Many of the basic functionality which one can expect from a compositor/window manager and also some more "advanced" features are already implemented, but the project is still in alpha stage, so expect more features and many bug fixes in the future.
